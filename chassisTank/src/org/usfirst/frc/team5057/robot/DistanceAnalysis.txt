When testing how far the robot moved at different speeds, we found the following data.
Though timer based navigation is not favored, the lack of encoders requires this method for
autonomous. All testing occured while the robot battery was at 12.30V +-.01V

WPLIB speed: .625
Estimated actual speed (m/s): .92

WPLIB speed: .75
Estimated actual speed (m/s): 1.66

.625 seemed to work consistently with least drift. This is reccomended speed for navigation during autonomous.

For turning during autonomous, speeds between .5 and .625 worked best with speeds closer to .5 having less drift.
.5 is the reccommended speed.


All data analysis was conducted on polished tile floor. Further testing is required to determing if speeds and drifts remain
on carpeted floor.



To avoid this sort of drift, using sonar sensors to fine tune distance when close to target is reccommended. For example,
if approaching the switch, timers can be used to get close to the scale and then sonar senor to approach the switch to an 
accurate distance. Encoders can provide more accuracy if they are avaliable.
